## Project Name
MatrixLibrary Project


## About
MatrixLibrary is a modern RESTful Book Library API built in Go using the Gin web framework and GORM ORM with SQLite as the database. It includes a frontend styled with a cool Matrix-inspired terminal aesthetic.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need Go, React, and TypeScript installed on your system.
Additional libraries are managed via Go modules (Gin, GORM, SQLite driver).


## Features
This MatrixLibrary includes these features:

* RESTful endpoints for managing books (CRUD operations)
* Backend API powered by Go, Gin, and GORM
* SQLite database persistence
* Stylish Matrix-themed frontend interface


## Getting Started & Installation


Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/MatrixLibrary.git`


## Usage
Run the Go script from the command line:
1. go run main.go
2. On front-end run npm run dev - make sure you change api routes in api/books.go to localhost (https://localhost:{port}/books

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

* Build a full-stack RESTful API in Go 
* Work with Gin for routing and GORM for database interactions
* Integrate a React-TypeScript frontend with a Go backend and learn more about useState/useEffect, preventDefault, conditional form logic creation through booleans and ternary expressions, guard clauses, http methods, library function implementation, server routing, and applying efficient logic in api endpoints
* Implement CRUD operations and database management
